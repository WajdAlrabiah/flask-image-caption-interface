# Flask Image Caption Interface

A Flask web application that allows users to submit messages or image URLs.  
If an image URL is detected, the app sends it to an image caption API and displays the generated caption.

## Features

- Simple web interface using HTML forms.
- Supports detecting image URLs (basic logic placeholder included).
- Sends image URLs to an external API for caption generation.
- Displays the API response on the same web page.


## Hello and Welcome

At the moment, I’m adding each project with some **light updates and clarifying adjustments**, and I plan to include more **comprehensive notes, explanations, and detailed READMEs** very soon — to help others better understand each project’s idea and usage.
